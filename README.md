# Puzzle Hub

## A brief description 

In an attempt to find quick games for me to play while waiting on line or just procrastinating, I decided to develop 
this application. This application is a hub where one can entertain oneself by playing puzzle games that are *randomly*
 generated while waiting for time to pass.

The choices of games are (for now):
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper
